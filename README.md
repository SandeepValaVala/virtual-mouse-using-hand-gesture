# virtual-mouse-using-hand-gesture
This is a repository for a hand gesture recognition system implemented using MediaPipe for hand tracking and Flask for web streaming. The system captures video from the webcam, processes it to detect hand gestures in real-time, and displays the live feed along with recognized gestures on a web interface.
